Description of C++ Project

Our team has chosen the project called 3D Modeling relating to 2D models and 3D models. 
We will design this project using analytical shapes. Under some discussion, we decided 
to create a two-dimensional coordinate and a three-dimensional coordinate or one coordinate
which can achieve functions of both 2D coordinate and 3D coordinate. Then, we are going 
to create some different shapes and lines in 2D coordinate, such as Bezier, spline, circle, 
rectangle, triangle, polygon, ellipse, Bezier and so on. When those 2D models are built up, 
we will calculate some parameters of them, like area and perimeter. We will also try to move 
and scale these models in this 2D coordinate.

In addition to 2D model, it is more complex to build 3D models. We are going to draw some 3D 
models, such as sphere, cube and cylinder in 3D coordinate. Then, we will design some functions
to compute the volume and superficial area of these regular 3D models. Whatâ€™s more, we will do 
some further steps which could make transforms of these models. For example, they can be rotated,
scaled and moved. Apart from these functions, we are going to make endeavor to design more
complex functions. We may create intersection, union or difference model of two 3D models.

To sum up, this project can achieve functions as following:
1.Create 2D and 3D models of different shapes.
2.Calculate some parameters of these models such as area and volume.
3.Do some transforms to these models such as move and scale.
